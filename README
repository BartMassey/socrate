Socrate - a "Socratic Method" callout generator
Copyright Â© 2011 Bart Massey


Socrate is a "Socratic Method" teaching tool. It generates a
list of random "callouts" from a student list. During class,
students are chosen to be called upon in list order. The
list is generated weighted-randomly, such that a student who
has been called upon relatively more is relatively less
likely to be called next.

Socrate is written in Python, and available as open source
under the MIT license.

To use the tool, first prepare a CSV state file called
socrate.txt containing lines of the form

  index,last,first,0,0,0

The index should be some kind of student index.
Invoke via

  python socrate.py 60 >callouts.txt

The state file will be automatically updated so that the
next callouts will be appropriately weighted, and the
callouts will be generated into the output file.
